Dodd Redstone Language Compiler
===============================


Summary
-------

The Dodd Redstone Language is a very simple, untyped, procedural language, primarily designed to target a custom redstone computer. I am writing this compiler for it primarily to teach myself, and potentially others, about how compilation works. The lexing and parsing components are generated with the [SableCC](https://sablecc.org/) parser generator. The language syntax specification can be found [here](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/Dodd-Redstone-Language-Compiler/blob/main/src/drl.sable).


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/turbodiesel4598/Dodd-Redstone-Language-Compiler/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
